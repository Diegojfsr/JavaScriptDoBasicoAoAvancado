# global keyword

In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope, and its global object is called the `window` object. Within the browser, `var something` will define a new global variable inside the `window` object. In Node.js, this is different. The top-level scope is **not** the global scope; `var something` inside a Node.js module will be local to that module.
