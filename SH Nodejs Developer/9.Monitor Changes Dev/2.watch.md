# --watch

The `--watch` flag in Node.js is a powerful feature introduced in Node.js version 19 that enables automatic reloading of your Node.js application whenever changes are detected in the specified files.

Here's How it works:

- You run your Node.js script with the `--watch` flag: `$ node --watch your_script.js`
- Node.js starts watching the specified file (or directory) for changes.
- Whenever a change is detected, Node.js automatically restarts the script
