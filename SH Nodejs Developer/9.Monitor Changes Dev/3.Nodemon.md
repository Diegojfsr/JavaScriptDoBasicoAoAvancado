# Nodemon

In Node.js, you need to restart the process to make changes take effect. This adds an extra step to your workflow. You can eliminate this extra step by using nodemon or PM2 to restart the process automatically.

`nodemon`Â is a command-line interface (CLI) utility developed by rem that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and automatically restarts the process.
