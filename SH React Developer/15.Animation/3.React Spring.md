# react spring

React Spring is a popular animation library for React that leverages the principles of spring physics to create smooth, natural-looking animations. Unlike traditional animation libraries that rely on keyframes and linear transitions, React Spring uses spring-based physics to produce fluid and realistic animations that can dynamically respond to user interactions and state changes.
