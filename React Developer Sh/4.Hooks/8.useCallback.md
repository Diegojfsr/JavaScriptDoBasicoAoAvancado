# useCallback

`useCallback`Â is a React hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It's used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. Specifically, it helps avoid recreating functions when their dependencies haven't changed, which can be useful when passing callbacks to child components that rely on referential equality to prevent re-rendering.
